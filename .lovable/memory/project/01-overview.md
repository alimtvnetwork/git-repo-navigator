# Project Overview

## What is gitmap?

gitmap is a portable Go CLI tool that scans directory trees for Git repositories, extracts clone URLs and branch information, and outputs structured data in multiple formats. It can also re-clone repositories from that data, preserving the original folder hierarchy.

## Current Version

**v2.17.0** (defined in `gitmap/constants/constants.go`)

## Tech Stack

- **CLI**: Go (compiled to `gitmap.exe`)
- **Database**: SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite` (CGo-free)
- **Build/Deploy**: PowerShell (`run.ps1`)
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind (documentation site, currently placeholder)
- **Config**: JSON (`powershell.json`, `data/config.json`)

## Key Directories

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `gitmap/` | Go source code for the CLI |
| `spec/01-app/` | App-specific specification documents |
| `spec/02-general/` | Reusable design patterns & guidelines (generic, shareable) |
| `src/` | React frontend (documentation site) |
| `.lovable/memory/` | AI memory and tracking |

## Database Tables (PascalCase)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `Repos` | Discovered Git repositories |
| `Groups` | Named collections of repos |
| `GroupRepos` | Join table linking repos to groups |
| `Releases` | Release metadata with changelog and source tracking (`release` or `import`) |

## Output Files (per scan)

All written to `gitmap-output/` inside the scanned directory:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Terminal output | Colored banner, repo list, folder tree, clone instructions |
| `gitmap.csv` | CSV with repo data |
| `gitmap.json` | JSON with repo data |
| `folder-structure.md` | Markdown folder tree |
| `clone.ps1` | PowerShell clone script with comments |
| `direct-clone.ps1` | Plain `git clone` commands (HTTPS) |
| `direct-clone-ssh.ps1` | Plain `git clone` commands (SSH) |
| `register-desktop.ps1` | GitHub Desktop registration script |

## Code Style Rules

- No negation in `if` conditions (no `!`, no `!=`)
- No `switch` statements — use `if`/`else if` chains
- Functions: 8–15 lines
- Files: 100–200 lines max
- One responsibility per package
- Blank line before `return` (unless sole line in `if` block)
- All string literals in `constants` package (no magic strings)
- All DB table/column names in PascalCase

## Version Policy

- **Bump on every code change** that alters behavior or output
- Follows SemVer (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
- Displayed in terminal banner, `help`, and `version` command
- `run.ps1` prints version after each build

## File Naming Convention

- All `.md` files use **lowercase-hyphen** naming (e.g. `01-overview.md`, `19-list-versions.md`)
- Go files use lowercase (e.g. `listversions.go`, `revertscript.go`)
